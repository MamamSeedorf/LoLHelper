### Additional Information

The Riot Games API keys are only valid for 24 hours, meaning that the API keys in this repository have expired. This does not affect functionality since 'playerstats' can also run purely on database data. However, this means that 'playerstats' can only be used on players who are already in the database.

One player that is in the database is:

**"ths22#EUW"**

You can input this into the search in 'playerstats,' and it will work regardless of whether the API key is expired or not.



### Testing
To run the unit tests close the server and write
```bash
npm test
```

### Fetching new games
This is not needed for the program to run, but if you wish to fetch new games to add to the database:
* First create an account on https://developer.riotgames.com/
* Then navigate to your user dashboard and generate a valid api key.
* Navigate to "../services/gameExtraction.mjs" and insert the api key in apiKeys.
* Run gameExtraction.mjs
* When done stop the program and the fetched games have been added to games.json
* Navigate to "models/dataAccess/dataBaseNavigator.mjs" and uncomment the following lines
  ```js
  // await insertGamesDataToDB();
  ```
* Run the file and now the games have been added to the database
